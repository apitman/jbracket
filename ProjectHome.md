JBracket is a project for the Vanderbilt University CS 278 Software Engineering course, fall 2008.  The intent of JBracket is to provide a tournament bracket management application which is not limited to 1v1 competitions or a max number of competitors.  It will also support the ability to customize rules for different rounds of the tournament.  Like other bracket programs, it will support different competitions, seeding types, and tournament models (e.g. single elimination, double elimination, round robin).
